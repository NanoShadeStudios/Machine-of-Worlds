Overarching game idea
Game theme idea: “The Machine of Worlds”

You’re building a strange, broken machine that creates “worlds.”

Each world you generate has a finite tree of upgrades (not limitless scaling).

The RNG comes from how each world rolls its properties (gravity, time speed, weather, etc.). That randomness affects how your resources interact.

Progress visualization: every time you complete a world, the machine physically gets more complex — new gears, pipes, lights, or pixels appear in the UI. The look shows how far you’ve gone, not just numbers.

Resources interact: maybe heat makes things run faster, but too much breaks parts and costs efficiency. Pressure multiplies output, but consumes heat or fuel. Everything ties back to your progress.

Length: Each world has its own “phase” of gameplay, with unique mechanics that unlock quickly. The fun comes from always getting new toys, not just waiting. Over ~300 hours, you discover layers of mechanics.

Visual style: Minimal pixel machine UI, maybe like Nodebuster meets Paperclips, clean but with personality.

Why this works

Finite upgrades: every world has a clear “end state” before you move on.

RNG: worlds roll different “quirks” or bonuses.

Progress visualization: the machine fills out and changes over time.

Interacting systems: heat, fuel, pressure, etc. combine to affect resources.

Longevity: tons of unique phases keep it fresh.

Minimal graphics: still fun to look at without being bloated.

Active: you’re constantly balancing or deciding, not waiting AFK.









Phase 1 Plan: Core Loop & Minimal Machine

Goal: Build a working prototype where the player can generate worlds, see progress, and have finite upgrades.

1. Project Setup

Create the project folder and structure (HTML + JS or your chosen language).

Set up minimal UI canvas/area for the machine visualization.

Create a basic save system (local storage or file-based, just for testing).

2. World Generation

Implement a “Create World” button.

Each world should have:

Unique ID

RNG-based properties (gravity, time speed, weather)

Finite upgrade points (e.g., 10–1000 resources to spend)

Show basic info on the UI (text for now).

3. Resources

Start with 1–2 basic resources (e.g., heat, fuel).

Allow these resources to increase when you do actions in a world.

Display them clearly on the UI.

4. Upgrades

Implement finite upgrades for the first resource:

Upgrade costs rise per level.

Maximum level clearly displayed.

Show progress visually (like a bar or filling machine part).

5. Progress Visualization

Create simple placeholders for machine parts (rectangles or minimal pixel art).

When a world is generated or an upgrade is bought, visually “add” machine parts.

Optional: color or highlight changes to show growth.

6. Core Loop Interaction

Player clicks to generate world → chooses upgrades → resources increase → machine parts appear.

Make this active, not idle: player decisions should matter each step.

7. Test & Polish Phase 1

Ensure:

Upgrades stop at max levels.

Resource gains and costs make sense.

Machine visual updates match progress.

Keep graphics minimal and clean.

No extra features yet (RNG quirks, interacting resources, long-term unlocks).

8. Phase 1 Goals Done When

Player can create worlds and see them affect the machine.

Player can spend resources on finite upgrades.

Machine visually grows with player progress.

Core active gameplay loop works without idle or AFK reliance.






















Phase 2 Plan: Expanding Mechanics & Strategic Depth

Goal: Introduce interacting systems, deeper RNG effects, more world variety, and advanced progression without breaking the Phase 1 structure.

1. World Property Interactions

Make world properties actively affect resources:

Gravity → affects heat generation multiplier.

Time Speed → affects fuel generation multiplier.

Weather → unique temporary bonuses (stormy boosts fuel, chaotic reduces efficiency, etc.)

Temperature → can add passive effects (too hot → heat decays slower, too cold → fuel generation slower)

Display small icons or visual indicators to show the effect on resources for clarity.

2. New Resources & Interactions

Add 2–3 new resources (e.g., Pressure, Energy, Stability):

Pressure could increase heat efficiency but consumes fuel.

Energy could multiply world effects temporarily.

Stability could affect RNG bonuses (low stability → higher chance for rare bonuses or mishaps).

Show visual resource bars with color-coded feedback.

Implement simple interactions between resources (like heat + pressure → temporary production spike).

3. Advanced Upgrades

Introduce upgrades that boost other upgrades/resources:

Example: “Thermal Accelerator” → Heat Generator produces 20% more when Pressure > 50.

Example: “Fuel Synchronizer” → Fuel Efficiency improves Energy generation.

Keep upgrades finite, with clear max levels.

Add a progress visualization for these new upgrades (progress bars or small machine nodes).

4. Rare Events & RNG

Implement beneficial random events to create strategic choices:

Rare world anomalies (e.g., Crystal Core world → +50% heat bonus temporarily).

Random machine glitches → require immediate player action to avoid minor resource loss.

Reward multipliers (e.g., “Lucky Flux” → next world gives double resources).

Show small, clear visual alerts on the canvas.

5. World Unlock System

Create world tiers:

Initial worlds (Phase 1): basic 8 types.

Later worlds unlock with certain upgrades/resources.

Each tier introduces more extreme property ranges and strategic trade-offs.

Add a progress bar or visual tree to show unlocked world tiers.

6. Machine Visualization Upgrades

Add animated machine parts when interacting with upgrades or resources:

Moving gears, pulsing energy lines, small sparks.

Introduce color-coded interaction highlights:

Parts glow or change color when a resource interaction occurs.

Optional: Mini “machine nodes” showing inter-resource connections.

7. Active Gameplay Enhancements

Introduce multi-step actions:

Some actions require combining resources for temporary boosts.

Example: Combine Heat + Fuel → create Energy → spend Energy for rare upgrade or bonus.

Display tooltips or hover text to explain effects (maintains clear guides).

Keep the loop active and decision-heavy, avoiding idle reliance.

8. UI & Feedback

Keep cyberpunk, minimalist aesthetic.

Add small visual indicators for RNG events, resource interactions, and active bonuses.

Keep layout clean; new features appear in expandable sections rather than cluttering UI.

9. Save & Progression

Continue local storage save system.

Add versioning so Phase 2 upgrades/resources/worlds are correctly saved.

Include manual export/import option for backup without forcing accounts.

10. Phase 2 Goals Done When

Player can interact with world properties and new resources.

RNG events affect gameplay meaningfully but positively.

Upgrades now have interactions across resources.

Machine visualization shows interactions clearly.

World unlock progression adds strategic depth.

Active gameplay is still the focus, with decisions impacting output.
