# The Machine of Worlds - TODO List

## Critical Issues / Bugs ðŸ”´

### Save System Issues
- [x] Remove debug console.log statements from GameState.js (lines 136-247)
- [x] Validate save data integrity on load to prevent corruption
- [x] Add save file backup/rollback system for critical failures

### Performance Issues
- [x] Remove excessive console.log statements from production code:
  - UpgradeSystem.js: Lines 6-27 (constructor and checkUpgradeUnlocksFixed debugging)
  - ResourceSystem.js: Lines 153-216 (resource generation debugging)
  - UISystem.js: Lines 22, 90-114, 150-168 (UI debugging)
  - Game.js: Lines 40-68, 102-109 (initialization debugging)

### Code Quality Issues
- [x] Remove temporary debug.js file (only contains localStorage check)
- [x] Remove empty game.js file (unused legacy file)
- [x] Clean up index_clean.html if it's outdated/unused

## Feature Improvements ðŸŸ¡

## Priority Legend:
ðŸ”´ Critical - Fix immediately
ðŸŸ¡ High - Complete this version
ðŸŸ  Medium - Next version
ðŸ”µ Low - Future versions
ðŸŸ£ Security - Ongoing priority
âœ… Testing - Continuous
ðŸ“š Documentation - Ongoing
ðŸš€ Future - Long-term goals

## Notes:
- Current codebase is generally stable with no critical compilation errors
- Main focus should be on removing debug code and improving user experience
- Save system is working but needs cleanup and additional features
- Achievement system and UI styling have been recently improved
- Machine visual system has been completely overhauled and is working well
